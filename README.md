# A Modular Drawing Kit for Machine Art Drawing

## JS Source
The source file for the BBC micro:bit is the Javascript version of the makecode it was originally written. To run this project you should import the Kitronik all-in-one robotic board library from the makecode on the micro:bit site [here](https://makecode.microbit.org/#).

### How to proceed
Open the *[makecode site](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)*, create a new project then first of all import from the extensions the Kitronik all-in-one robotic library. Select Java in the editor page then copy and paste the Javascript source from the repository.

*The same program can work as well without the board and in this case no library should be imported, but some changes to the motor control functions should be added.

## Drawing and Rendering Stuff
The folders **[STL](STL)** and **[SVG](SVG)** contain the files needed for 3D print and laser-cut the moving parts. As well, if you plan to use a different motor for the wheels, the motor support should be redesigned. The laser-cut parts can also be printed on carboard and cut bu hand.

### 3D Rendering
Below the 3D model rendering of the 3D printed parts. The design has been created with Fusion360.
